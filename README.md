## The Process
I never realized how hard designing a website would be. I give major props to Web Designers, the process is a lot harder than one would think. I decided to use a mix of modern fonts and layouts. My portfolio presents the type of projects I've worked on, more about myself, what I've been up to during quarantine, and how to contact me.

- ReactJS

### Landing Page
![Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59525393/106213983-ee2c2000-6171-11eb-8569-170a6484dcd5.png)
Once the page finishes loading (sorry if it takes long, it's probably because the picture is so HQ you can even see my pores), you're greeted with a great picture of my face, you can't miss me in public. For the navbar, I used a sticky navbar with a translucent background making sure the user could view every part of the page no matter what component they're viewing. I implimented the React Scroll library with this project, allowing users to click the different component pages within the navbar, toggling an automatic slow scroll to the segment with the matching id within the component's container. I also styled the component titles within the navbar to have a hover over and active color to indicate which part of the page the user is viewing.
