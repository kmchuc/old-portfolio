## The Process
I never realized how hard designing a website would be. I give major props to Web Designers, the process is a lot harder than one would think. I decided to use a mix of modern fonts and layouts. My portfolio presents the type of projects I've worked on, more about myself, what I've been up to during quarantine, and how to contact me. 

## Technologies
My portfolio was created using:
- ReactJS
- React Router Dom
- React Scroll
- React Icons

### Landing Page
![Landing Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59525393/106213983-ee2c2000-6171-11eb-8569-170a6484dcd5.png)
Once the page finishes loading (sorry if it takes long, it's probably because the picture is so HQ you can even see my pores), you're greeted with a great picture of my face, you can't miss me in public. For the navbar, I used a sticky navbar with a translucent background making sure the user could view every part of the page no matter what component they're viewing. I implimented the React Scroll library with this project, allowing users to click the different component pages within the navbar, toggling an automatic slow scroll to the segment with the matching id within the component's container. I also styled the component titles within the navbar to have a hover over and active color to indicate which part of the page the user is viewing.

### works

The works page contains the projects I've had the priviledge to work on. Other than this portfolio, these projects are full stack web applications I've worked on. The titles of each project are clickable links that will redirect you to either the deployed site or the project's github repository. As I continue to work on projects I will be adding them to the works pages of this site.

The kim. page includes a brief description about myself and my nontraditional background. I would like to add more features to this page such as my skills and resume. 

### contact me

The final component on my portoflio is the contact me page. This includes links to my email (opens email app and composes new email), linkedin profile, and github profile!

## Reflection
One of my new year resolutions was to explore the creative side of my brain more. With that in mind, I happend to hit a lot of creative blocks throughout the process. Overall, my portfolio took me a month to finish. I wanted to make a site that would represent my mind but I soon realized that would be impossible so I decided to go with a clean minimalistic look. I also created my own logo, a simple 5 petalled flower with the letters "k m c" within the flower. These initials represent my full name Kimberly Mako Chuc. This was my first time fully creating a project with React in terms of styling. This was not my first time using React Router DOM but this time around I had to go through its documentation and actually learn its full capabilities. 

The most challenging part of this project was designing the layout of the web app. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with a 90s theme or modern aesthetic. In the end I had already created an AIM look-a-like login window which would serve as a personalized interactive landing page. After fully creating, I wasn't sure what direction I wanted to go in. This was the most difficult part of the design process. I didn't like where it was headed. So instead, I decided to scrap the entire design and went with a more simplistic approach. 

This portfolio was a really great learning experience. The biggest lesson I learned was to appreciate the process web designers have to go through. In the softwar engineering world, most times we don't worry about how things look, its just whether not information is being properly sent and recieved from the database to the client side. I hope to learn a bit more about the fundamentals of UI/UX after this, I'm really looking forward to it.
