            <AboutMeText>Welcome! My name is Kim and I’m a full stack developer from Hawaii currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a passion for creating clean and efficient code, products that communicate unique user experiences, and continuing to expand my scope of experience as a developer. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BS in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and worked as an EMT until I found my passion for coding. After self learning Python for a year, I graduated from Hackbright Academy’s Software Engineering Fellowship and am excited to be searching for my first position within the tech industry. </AboutMeText>
